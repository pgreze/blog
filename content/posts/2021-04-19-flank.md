I will soon give a live presentation about Flank
(my first time giving a public presentation + IN JAPANESE).
I'm sure you can easily imagine my stress right now üòÑ

So in order to give me confidence, I decided to also write a blog post about
my experience using this wonderful tool, allowing us to both reduce our waiting time
but also bringing us new opportunities, thanks to the way Flank was implemented.

# Flank presentation

If you're already using Android E2E (end-to-end, aka UI tests) tests,
you already probably know Firebase Test Lab.
It's a Google service allowing to access on-demand virtual or real devices,
in order to run a variety of tests.
For traditional Android development,
mainly Instrumentation tests (= Espresso and UI Automator) and
Robo test (no code) are supported.

With Test Lab, you have access to a YAML based configuration providing
everyone the access to multiple device types (Samsung, Sony, etc)
or API versions (from 19 to latest ones)
in order to run your tests.

# Traditional use with gcloud

The default way to use Test Lab is through its gcloud integration,
which is the command line application provided by Google in order to access
various Google Cloud services (because Firebase is a part of it).

You don't even have to use any YAML to start using it:

```bash
gcloud firebase test android run \
  --type instrumentation \
  # Generated with ./gradlew app:assembleDebug
  --app app-debug-unaligned.apk \
  # Generated with ./gradlew app:assembleDebugAndroidTest
  --test app-debug-test-unaligned.apk \
  --device model=Nexus6,version=21,locale=en,orientation=portrait \
  --device model=Nexus7,version=29,locale=fr,orientation=landscape
```

Sadly the default mode is suffering some limitations:
1. all tests run sequentially, particularly annoying when considering that E2E tests are usually taking few seconds depending on your needs,
2. based on Python, which needs to be available locally and/or in your CI depending on your needs,
3. always has new updates, which is becoming frustrating if you're just using once in a while...

All there reasons motivated me to try this new tool I found for quite some time
but didn't spend more time, wrongly thinking setup parallel execution would be a pain.

# Real scale use with Flank

[Flank](https://flank.github.io/flank/) is providing many features out-of-the-box:
+ Test sharding (= parallel)
+ YAML compatible with gcloud
+ Cost reporting
+ Stability testing
+ HTML report
+ JUnit XML

All the magic behind Flank is powered by the
[linkedin/dex-test-parser](https://github.com/linkedin/dex-test-parser)
library, which is allowing a new way of orchestrating your test execution
compared to the black-box approach used by gcloud.
That's because Flank knows in advance all test methods
before executing any logic in an Android device
that it can offer new features like easy test sharding.

Also considering an Android developer or an Android friendly CI has always
access to a JVM, the fact that Flank is implemented in Kotlin is allowing
to easily download the [latest version in Github](https://github.com/Flank/flank/releases/latest)
and start using it from 1 command:

```bash
$ curl -L https://github.com/Flank/flank/releases/download/v21.03.1/flank.jar -o flank.jar
$ java -jar flank.jar
flank.jar
 [-v] [--debug] [COMMAND]
      --debug     Enables debug logging
  -v, --version   Prints the version
Commands:
  firebase
  ios
  android
  refresh            Downloads results for the last Firebase Test Lab run
  cancel             Cancels the last Firebase Test Lab run
  auth               Manage oauth2 credentials for Google Cloud
  provided-software
  network-profiles   Explore network profiles available for testing.
  ip-blocks          Explore IP blocks used by Firebase Test Lab devices.
```

## Easily migrate from gcloud to Flank

Flank is supporting the same configuration syntax than gcloud,
plus some additions in a dedicated section,
which is allowing to easily switch between each other.

Here is the most basic example we're using in order to run tests in Mercari:

```yaml
gcloud:
  results-history-name: Flank for app_jp
  timeout: 45m
  record-video: true
  use-orchestrator: true
  test-targets:
    - size large
  environment-variables:
    clearPackageData: true
  device:
    - model: beyond1
      version: 28
      orientation: portrait
      locale: ja_JP
    - model: flame
      version: 29
      orientation: portrait
      locale: ja_JP
flank:
  ## test shards - the amount of groups to split the test suite into
  max-test-shards: 8
  ## test runs - the amount of times to run the tests.
  num-test-runs: 1
  ## The billing enabled Google Cloud Platform project name to use
  project: my-firebase-project
  ## The max time this test run can execute before it is cancelled (default: unlimited).
  run-timeout: 180m
```

## Or from Gradle

If you're planning to mainly use it locally or in a simple CI flow,
the [Gradle plugin](https://github.com/runningcode/fladle)
is allowing Gradle users to configure it without having to write any YAML code üôå

```groovy
fladle {
    // Required parameters
    serviceAccountCredentials = project.layout.projectDirectory.file("account.json")
    variant = "freeDebug"
    // Optional parameters
    useOrchestrator = false
    environmentVariables = [
        "clearPackageData": "true"
    ]
    // etc...
```

## Or from Github actions

If you're using Github Actions, there's even a provided
[Github Action](https://github.com/Flank/flank/blob/master/docs/flank-github-action/store_documentation.md)
allowing to integrate it in your existing workflows üëç

```YAML
- name: flank run
  id: flank_run
  uses: Flank/flank@master
  with:
    # Flank version to run
    version: v21.03.1
    # Service account file content from secrets
    service_account: ${{ secrets.SERVICE_ACCOUNT }} 
    # Run Android tests
    platform: android
    # Path to configuration file from local repo
    flank_configuration_file: './testing/android/flank-simple-success.yml'

- name: output
  run: |
    # Use local directory output
    echo "Local directory: ${{ steps.flank_run.outputs.local_results_directory }}"
    # Use Gcloud storage output 
    echo "Gcloud: ${{ steps.flank_run.outputs.gcloud_results_directory }}"
```

The ability to use a past action outputs by referring it through its ID
is something I discovered with this integration, and which is really helpful
when you're having to maintain complex workflows using several tools.

# Test sharing challenges

Sadly, run your UI tests in parallel is not possible
without bringing some new challenges.
You need to be aware of them beforehand,
otherwise you'll probably waste your or your team-mates time
when having to debug this kind of issue.

## Tests dependency

This kind of issue can be illustrated by this simple scenario,
showing how use a common user account across all your tests
can cause unexpected issues:

1. Test1 is logged with UserA.
2. Test2 login with the same UserA.
3. A login notification is displayed in Test1, breaking the test flow...

It could already appear when using gcloud,
but because Flank can be highly parallelized,
this kind of issue may break way more tests over time.

Even if this article is not aiming to give all solutions to this problem,
be aware of all your test dependencies like:
1. user accounts,
2. backend access (and their changes over time),
3. backend scalability (it will be more overloaded with multiple tests running in parallel).

## Test Lab device availability

By requesting a high number of devices,
you may have to wait longer before having access to these shared resources.

The waiting time is highly depending on the device you're requesting.
In our cases, we noticed a quick shortage with a specific Samsung device
which was leading our CI waiting more than 3 hours without success...

Here is an example of how this error was happening for us:
{{< image src="/assets/2021-04-19-flank/test-lab-inconclusive.png" position="center" >}}

Sadly it's impossible for now to predict when a device is available or not in Test Lab,
and even the latest versions of Test Lab dashboard is recommending to contact the Firebase team
in the official Firebase Slack, in order to get support, and hopefully alternatives to the device
that you faced issues to access.

# Flank on steroids with "Smart Flank"

The basic example I gave before was considering a fixed number of devices,
but Flank is capable of arranging your test execution
in order to minimize the number of devices you're using,
while hopefully ensuring the defined execution time you requested when configurating it.

This smart way is accessible only when leveraging 
some specific configurations in the provided YAML:

```YAML
flank:
  ### Max Test Shards
  ## test shards - the amount of groups to split the test suite into
  ## set to -1 to use one shard per test. default: 1
  # max-test-shards: 1

  ### Shard Time
  ## shard time - the amount of time tests within a shard should take
  ## when set to > 0, the shard count is dynamically set based on time up to the maximum limit defined by max-test-shards
  ## 2 minutes (120) is recommended.
  ## default: -1 (unlimited)
  # shard-time: -1

  ### Smart Flank GCS Path
  ## Google cloud storage path where the JUnit XML results from the last run is stored.
  ## NOTE: Empty results will not be uploaded
  # smart-flank-gcs-path: gs://tmp_flank/tmp/JUnitReport.xml

  ### Use Average Test Time for New Tests flag
  ## Enable using average time from previous tests duration when using SmartShard and tests did not run before.
  ## Default: false
  # use-average-test-time-for-new-tests: true

  ### Default Test Time 
  ## Set default test time used for calculating shards.
  ## Default: 120.0
  # default-test-time: 15

  ### Default Class Test Time
  ## Set default test time (in seconds) used for calculating shards of parametrized classes when previous tests results are not available.
  ## Default test time for classes should be different from the default time for test
  ## Default: 240.0
  # default-class-test-time: 30
```

As you can see, the main challenge is to have access to the previously runned Junit report,
in order to use past execution results when running the same tests again.

I didn't really consider this way of using Flank so far
because we're not having a big difference of time between our tests.
And even if save and restore files between jobs in our CI is easy,
I guess the multi device type setup we're using would mean
we should probably consider carefully which report to use for which execution...

But if you're just running your tests on 1 device,
it's probably worth investigating this improvement.

# Easily extend Flank with your Kotlin skills

If you already know Kotlin (it should be true because you're probably working Android),
you can easily extend Flank capabilities with some custom code,
in order to add new YAML filters or any other improvements you may benefit.

Here are [an example](https://github.com/mercari/flank/pull/8/files)
where I added a new test filter, based on our company's test naming conventions.

Be able to extend and validate this kind of logic
without having to run an Instrumented test
is definitely an enjoyable experience.
And the Flank codebase is not too big,
allowing to quickly start hacking with it.

# Conclusion

Hopefully you will not wait as long as us before migrating from gcloud to Flank,
and start enjoying faster UI test execution and if you're lucky,
drop the powerful but convoluted gcloud from your toolset.

On my side, I wish I could give a great presentation and
could explain well all these informations in Japanese üòÖ
