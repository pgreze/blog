title: Debug Android Gradle Plugin
tags: ["Android", "Gradle"]

This content could be a part of the yesterday article but
I think it's too important, so let's publish a dedicated one about these tips
used for debugging Gradle and Gradle Android Plugin like a **real Android tools developer**.

Some use cases:

- Debug TaskManager.java where all tasks are loaded and understand AGP
- Found reason of this unknown/cryptic lint issue during build

<!--more-->

## Debug Gradle itself

Open Gradle sources on Intellij:

```
git clone https://github.com/gradle/gradle
./gradlew idea
```

Start a build waiting debugger:

```
./gradlew --no-daemon -Dorg.gradle.debug=true task
```

And use the "Remote debug port 5005" in Run/Debug configurations list generated by idea task.
(see [gradle/idea.gradle](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/tree/master/gradle/idea.gradle)
script if you're curious about how this was declared)

## Debug Android Gradle Plugin

For that, we need to reference AGP in Intellij.
Luckily, we already downloaded them while working on our Android projects.

Just go to Intellij Project structure > Project Settings > Modules and add following jars
under **~/.gradle/caches/modules-2/files-2.1/com.android.tools.build/**:

- gradle-core/2.3.0/895cde36ab5bc7cfcb8e68b520c73e9c05e96841/gradle-core-2.3.0.jar
- builder/2.3.0/e2f05a09930ca699f9ca64b21564f252eca24fc9/builder-2.3.0.jar

Select add JARs or libraries:

And see the result:

Nice, but it's just unreadable binary files... We need also **sources code**!!

You have 2 choices: download them via Google maven repo:

- https://maven.google.com/com/android/tools/build/gradle-core/3.0.0-alpha4/gradle-core-2.0.0-alpha4-sources.jar
- https://maven.google.com/com/android/tools/build/builder/3.0.0-alpha4/builder-2.0.0-alpha4-sources.jar

But I personally prefer to just do like before via gradle cache, by looking for files like **gradle-core-2.3.0-sources.jar**.

Now, you're ready to debug AGP inside Intellij:

## Patching AGP

Not only AGP but after inspecting a Gradle plugin,
if you would like to change a behavior or try to fix an issue, how to patch it?

Twitter (quick/hacky) solution is to use [buildSrc](https://docs.gradle.org/3.3/userguide/organizing_build_logic.html#sec:build_sources),
where you can put classes added to classpath before others dependencies,
and will replace default plugin implementation.

An example where 2 AGP classes are replaced by our Java files:
